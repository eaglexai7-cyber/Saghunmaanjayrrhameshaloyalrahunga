            <p>Shagun, I know we haven't known each other for long, and it's natural if you don't trust me yet. But I want to be honest—I am truly, deeply into you.</p>
            <p>I’m so sorry I wasn't there that day, and for the things I said in our chat. I liked you even then, but I was just scared to admit it. I know there are many people who like you and might understand you better than I do right now.</p>
            <p>But I promise you this: <b>My loyalty is yours.</b> I won't be like your past. I just need one chance to prove that I'm here to stay. <b>Ek chance de de, you won't regret it.</b></p>
